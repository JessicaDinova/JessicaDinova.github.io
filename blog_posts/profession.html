                <p class="prof_blog"> Profession</p><br><br>
                <h3> <span class="tab"></span> When I was a little girl I fell in love with videogames, my first videogame was Assissin's Creed Brotherhood. I was madly in love with the environment, characters and story, later I've learned that the company behind this amazing game was Ubisoft.<br> <span class="tab"></span> I started my research about this company and that was the first time I was introduced to a thing called programming. All of a sudden I knew what I wanted to be when I grow up – a programmer. I enrolled into my high school and I learned some basic programming languages such as C++, SQL and more.<br> <span class="tab"></span> But now when I am attending university I have the opportunity to learned more then I ever did about programming videogames. Every step of my studying process will lead to one thing – work. That’s why I’ve decided to write this post so I can clearly see my most desired job employers.</h3> <br><br>
                <p class="title_blog"><span class="tab"></span>Rockstar Games</p><br>
                <h3><span class="tab"></span>My first desired job employer is Rockstar Games. Rockstar is concentrating on making AAA videogames such as Red Dead Redemption series, Grand Theft Auto series or Max Payne. Rockstar offers many different job positions like animation programmer, technical artist, graphic programmer, physics programmer, UI tools programmer, engine programmer or animation tools programmer.<br><span class="tab"></span>When working for Rockstar you’ll be mainly using their own game engine called RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine) for creating characters, environments or animations. This massive company is also known for allowing you to meet your personal  goals, learning new things in amazingly positive teams or taking your time off to spend it with you family basically whenever you need it.<br><span class="tab"></span>Rockstar has made videogames that everybody knows, loves and played almost hundred times. I adore how can Rockstar make one of the most popular games on the world while still carrying for their employees.</h3><br>
                <p class="title_blog"><span class="tab"></span>CD Project Red</p><br>
                <h3><span class="tab"></span>My another desired job employer is CD Project Red known for creating my favorite game called Witcher or Cyberpunk. CD is also concentrating on making AAA videogames in original polish dubbing which can be so much more funnier then it might sound. Witcher was such a popular game that even Obama in one of his speeches said it was one of the best game he has ever played.<br><span class="tab"></span>This company mainly located in Poland is offering job opportunities for every part of the game like backend software engineer, visual technical artists, UI artist, tools programmer, multiplayer programmer, engine programmer, physics programmer, quests designer, story tech programmer and so much more. CD is currently using Unreal Engine 5 founded by Epic Games to create their characters, landscapes and animations. CD was named one of the best employees for the year 2021 and for a good reason.<br><span class="tab"></span>They are giving you flexible work schedule, space for personal growth, advancement opportunities, supportive management and a lot of financial benefits. When someone mentions Witcher I get “goosebumps” all over my body just because how of a good game it was. That’s the feeling I want to evoke in people when they are going to play games that I’ve helped to develop.</h3><br>
                <p class="title_blog"><span class="tab"></span>My beloved Ubisoft</p><br>
                <h3><span class="tab"></span>My last desired job employer has to be Ubisoft. Ubisoft has dedicated to enriching the lives of the player by developing high-quality games that will drag you into the beauty of storytelling  and environment. Ubisoft is also offering many job offers and internships for everyone such as frontend animator, game designer, software engineering manager, UI technical artist, lead game designer, environment artist, VFX artist and much more.<br><span class="tab"></span>To create a beautiful game Ubisoft is using Snowdrop engine to bring their creations to platforms like PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft. Employees of Ubisoft really love working for them for several reasons: great work-life balance, events after work, opportunity to visit E3 events in LA and some really nice gifts for you. And not to mention you are allowed to play video games as a form of relax within your work hours.<br><span class="tab"></span>Ubisoft was the first company to swallow me in videogames and I would love to repay them with myself. Working for Ubisoft is one of my biggest dreams of all time, and as I could see they would treat me with respect that everyone working on a big videogame deserves.</h3><br><br>
