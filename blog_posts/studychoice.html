                <h3><span class="tab"></span>After my graduation in my High School I wanted to take all of my programming skills and push them to another level. After all I really loved and enjoyed the process of programming new things. And of course my long-term dream was to be a videogame programmer. But there was a little catch I had to face.</h3> <br>
                <h3><span class="tab"></span>My home country – Slovakia is not developed in such a way I wanted it to be. What was new in programming in Slovakia was considered old and unnecessarily complicated everywhere else. Therefore I applied for HZ university in Netherlands, away from my family and friends. </h3><br>
                <h3><span class="tab"></span>While I’m studying at HZ I am hoping to learn new programming languages, working in team, leading a team and how to quickly find effective solutions to all kinds of problems.</h3><br>
                <h3><span class="tab"></span>After completing my studies I would love to work in videogame industry as a developer or even a designer. Why developer? Because I enjoy finding solutions and mind games where you really have to “set your brain on fire”.</h3><br>
                <h3><span class="tab"></span>But being a designer is really far away from being a developer. Let me explain. I am always fascinated by the beauty of videogames – their environment, storylines, characters and animations. Thus I would really enjoy making these things myself and I’ve always had some spare creativity and designing in me.</h3>
