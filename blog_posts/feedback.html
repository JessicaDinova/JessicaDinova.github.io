                <h3>Hi Jessica, welcome</h3> <br><br>
                <h3>Motivation: Great you already have some experience with programming and enjoyed it! what exactly about is do you find pleasurable? What made you choose Middelburg instead of other colleges? </h3><br>
                <h3>Future job: You say you would love to work in the videogame industry, good you already have an idea, I would suggest you select a video game developing company and dive in deep to see what is expected of people working there and what they should be able to do. it might give you some additional inspiration and motivation</h3><br>
                <h3>SWOT: You say you get angry easily. What do you need to develop, learn, put in place to not let this get in the way of study success? Do you know why you get angry? If you know why (the real why) you might be able to deal better with it. Also keep in mind you do not have to stay in any situation you do not want to be in, stepping out is a very good skill to learn and then returning once everything is calmed down. how come uou lose motivation when surrounded by people how can you use people to stay motivated? Keep in mind that Working in IT is mainly people work so really do some effort in figuring out if this is the right line of study for you, or work in the issue.</h3><br>

              <p class="title_blog"><span class="tab"></span>My thoughts</p><br><br>
              <h3><span class="tab"></span>Feedback is really extensive and constructed in positive manners. Mrs. Daphne really dive into it and wanted to guide me onto the right path. In SWOT analysis she explained that working in IT is “people work” and I should work on my ager issues if I really what to take this journey of becoming a programmer.</h3><br>
              <h3><span class="tab"></span>I can disagree because I said that I don’t like to work with people but that’s where the communication failed and we did not understand each other. It’s true that I don’t like to work with them but I did not specified which part.</h3><br>
              <h3><span class="tab"></span>To clarify I like people but I don’t like to be “squished” in mass of them. I get the feeling like I cannot breathe anymore and that’s scares me. I also don’t like getting  touched by people, I just feel like they are invading my personal space and that’s the break point when my emotions take over me and I loose motivation. </h3><br>
              <h3><span class="tab"></span>Overall I really enjoyed to read this feedback and I mainly concentrated on things that I can improve so that I could become better person.</h3><br>
