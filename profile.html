    <p>PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
    <p>My name is Jessica Dinova, I am 19 years old and I studied at the high school of electrial engineering and my main subjects were: economics, programming and electrical engineering</p>
    <p>MOTIVATE YOUR STUDY CHOICE </p>
    <P>In my school we have learned some basics of C++ and SQL languages and I really enjoyed the process of learning them. In my free time I liked to create some programes like calculator or dice rolling with them and I enjoyed it very much. Therefore I wanted to learn some more or improve my skills via this programme. </P>
    <P>AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY...</P>
    <P>I would love to work in a videogame industry as developer or designer. I was always fascinated by the beauty of videogames and every time I was playing I would admire the work they've put into it. I expect to learn how to program at the highest level, how to be part of a team or how to lead one and how to use my critical thinking to solve problems. </P>
