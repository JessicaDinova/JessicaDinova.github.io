As my form or graduation I had the opportunity to create my own application that would determine my final grade. I’ve chosen to make an app to help you study and remember your important definition of words.<br> But tha wasn't enough for me and I’ve applied for the ICT program here in HZ. I know that it’s hard to learn new programming languages but I have to keep pushing so that I can achieve my long-term dream – to create videogames.  In addition I get to learn even more then how to create them.<br> And as we say in Slovakia “z každého rožka troška” - in translation “a little from every corner” I can be educated in multiple things at the same time – which had never hurt anyone.</p>
