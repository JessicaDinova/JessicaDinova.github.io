                <p class="blog_text"><span class="tab"></span>My former High school was concentrated on electrical engineering therefore my subjects were: economics, programming and electrical engineering. I fell in love with programming. I have learned some basics of languages like C++, SQL, HTML, CSS and C#. I was working on several projects with those languages called “sprints”. </p> <br><br>
                <p class="blog_text"><span class="tab"></span>The main point of those “sprints” was to learn how to thing fast, make ERD diagram and find solutions in given period of time. I honestly liked it that much that one of my form of graduation I’ve chosen to make my own application that would determinate one of my grades. I was using everything that I’ve learn for the past 4 years in my school. </p><br><br>
                <p class="blog_text"><span class="tab"></span>I’ve created application that was supposed to help you learn or to remember key words like your history dates and what happened in that year, mathematic equations or description / meaning of a certain words. Teachers really loved it and they’ve asked me to give them to code so they could use it as certain form of their own teaching technique. </p><br>
